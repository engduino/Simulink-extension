% <<../img/Modelling/rgb_led_selector.PNG>>
%
% Functions similar to the *rgb_led* block. The only difference is the LED index is 
% set with an input signal instead of a parameter. This will allows you to 
% use your algorithm to control which LED to light up.  
% Both the LED index and the three color values must be in the range 0-15.
% 
%% Example
% Refer to the <rgb_led.html#Example rgb_led block example>.
%
%% Data type
% Input data type is uint8_t
